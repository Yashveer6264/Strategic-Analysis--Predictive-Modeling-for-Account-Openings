# Projection of Account Opening Scenarios

## Overview

This project involves the development of a forecasting model to predict customer interest in opening bank accounts. The model achieved an AUC of 0.78 by leveraging diverse techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, random forests (with PCA), gradient boosting, and SVM. Utilizing demographic and behavioral data, the predictive models are tailored to optimize customer acquisition strategies.
